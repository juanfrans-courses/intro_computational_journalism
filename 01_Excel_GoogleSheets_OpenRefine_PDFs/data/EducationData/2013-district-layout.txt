README.TXT file for the 2013 SAIPE School District Estimates FTP Directory
 
I.    File Organization:

    The files in the data directory contain estimates of population and
    poverty.  

    The school districts for which we have estimates were 
    identified in the 2013 school district mapping survey,
    which asked about all school districts as of January 1, 2014 and 
    used school district boundaries for the 2013-2014 school year.

    The 2013 estimates are consistent with the population controls and 
    income concepts used in the 2013 American Community Survey single-year 
    estimates.    

    There is one file for each of the states, the District of Columbia, and 
    the entire United States.  Each file contains the FIPS state code, 
    Department of Education Common Core of Data (CCD) ID numbers, District names, 
    the total population, population of school-age children, and estimated 
    number of school-age children in poverty related to the head of the household.

                                 every school district in the nation)

        2) sd13_[STATE].txt     (Smaller files containing estimates for 
                                 every school district in an individual State)

           where [STATE] = standard two-letter postal abbreviations.
